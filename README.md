# Modern Design Patterns

This repository contains the most common design patterns written in modern C++. I made this as an exercise but it might be useful for other students.

Every subfolder contains another README.md with detailed explanation.

## Patterns

The patterns in this repo are:

- [x] Strategy Pattern
- [x] Observer Pattern
- [ ] Factory Pattern
- [ ] Abstract Factory Pattern
- [ ] Singleton Pattern
- [ ] Builder Pattern
- [ ] Decorator Pattern
- [ ] Adapter pattern
- [ ] Iterator pattern

## Building

To build the project (Unix):

```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build/
$ cmake ../
$ make
```

`cmake` is required for this.
